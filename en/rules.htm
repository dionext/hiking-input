<h1>Rules of the hiking </h1>
<p> Rules in the hiking are based on three principles: not to harm itself, not to harm 
<span lang="en-us">other people</span> and not to harm the nature. </p>
<h2>Time calculation </h2>
<p> Correct calculation of prospective time of a campaign is especially important for one-day 
<span lang="en-us">hiking </span>when route passage is carried out without independent spending the night.&nbsp;At campaigns on flat district calculation is simple and is based that average speed of walking <span lang="en-us">- 5 </span>km/hour.<span lang="en-us"> 
</span>It is necessary to put time for halts and a possible deviation from a route, and also on speeding up of obstacles (for example, the rivers). Carefully study a district map before a campaign. <span lang="en-us">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p> In mountain campaigns of a rule of calculation of time more difficult. We result calculation from a site of the Alpine union. <a href="http://www.alpenverein.at/portal/news/aktuelle_news_kurz/2018/2018_06_14_wie-berechnet-man-die-gehzeit-auf-wanderwegen.php">http://www.alpenverein.at/portal/news/aktuelle_news_kurz/2018/2018_06_14_wie-berechnet-man-die-gehzeit-auf-wanderwegen.php</a> see also <span lang="en-us">&quot;</span>Naismith's rule<span lang="en-us">&quot;</span> 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith's_rule">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith%27s_rule</a><br />
</p>
<p> Rough values for calculation of time of walking:<br />
</p>
<ul>
				<li>About 300 metres of height at an o'clock for lifting</li>
				<li>About 500 metres of height at an o'clock for draining off</li>
				<li>About 4 kilometres across at an o'clock</li>
</ul>
<p> At first we count both values (time of walking for a difference in height or for horizontal distance) separately. Then smaller value decreases twice and is added to большему to value.<br />
</p>
<p> Example: 1200 м and 8 km of distance to huts (lifting). At height of 1200 metres lifting occupies about 4 hours, and the 8-kilometre horizontal distance adds even 2 hours. Smaller value (2 hours) decreases twice and is added to 
<span lang="en-us">larger</span> value. So, 4 hours + 1 hour = 5 hours of an ascension.</p>

<h2>Safety in a campaign</h2>
<h3>Possible hazards of outdoor recreation </h3>
<p>The survey is based on&nbsp; the article &quot;Hazard of outdoor recreation&quot; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazards_of_outdoor_recreation">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazards_of_outdoor_recreation</a></p>
<p>Outdoor recreation, such as hiking, camping, canoeing, cycling, or skiing, 
entails risks, even if participants do not recklessly place themselves in harm&#39;s 
way. In some circumstances, such as being in remote locations or in extreme 
weather conditions, even a minor accident may create a dangerous situation that 
requires survival skills. However, with correct precautions, even fairly 
adventurous outdoor recreation can be enjoyable and safe. </p>
<h3>General safety measures</h3>
<p><br />
Every hazard has its own safety measure, and every ailment a particular remedy. 
A standard precaution for all back country activities is carrying the &quot;ten 
essentials&quot;, a collection of tools chosen for their utility in preventing or 
reacting to various emergencies.[1] </p>
<p>The common practice of traveling in a group improves safety in all regards. 
If one person is injured, group members can administer first aid or seek help. A 
group can avoid poor decisions that a lone traveler might make. If an emergency 
occurs, a group can pool its muscle power, brain power, and body heat. </p>
<p>Another precaution is informing people outside of the group of the itinerary 
and expected return time (expected hiking time can be estimated using Naismith&#39;s 
rule). A communication device, such as a cell phone or a satellite phone, may 
help in the case of an emergency. However, with the exception of mountain tops 
that are in line-of-sight to populated areas, cell phone coverage in wilderness 
areas is often quite poor. In the wilderness one should always be prepared to 
hike out for help, if necessary.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Dangerous circumstances</h3>
<h4>Bad weather </h4>
<p>Blizzards, flash floods, fog, dust or sandstorms, tornados, and other 
meteorological events may or may not be predictable, and may require immediate 
response for survival. Lightning is a frequent and serious threat in many 
regions</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Hazardous terrain</h4>
<p>Exposure is a climbing and hiking term. Sections of a hiking path or climbing 
route are described as &quot;exposed&quot; if there is a high risk of injury in the event 
of a fall because of the steepness of the terrain. If such routes are negotiated 
without any protection, a false step can result in a serious fall. The 
negotiation of such routes can cause fear of falling because of the potential 
danger.</p>
<p>&quot;Exposed&quot; sections of a path or a route can cause fear as well as serious 
problems for climbers and walkers in mountainous terrain if they lack a head for 
heights. However, what may feel exposed to some people, may hardly affect others 
at all. In critical situations it is therefore necessary, either to turn back or 
to use a protective measure such as a rope; some paths have fixed ropes, chains, 
ladders, etc. The anxiety caused by the exposure reduces with habituation, but 
even experienced climbers often have to get used to heights again at the start 
of the climbing season<span lang="en-us">.</span></p>
<p>Sure-footedness refers to the ability, especially when hiking or mountain 
climbing, to negotiate difficult or rough terrain safely. Such situations place 
demands on a person&#39;s coordination and reserves of strength as well as requiring 
sufficient appreciation of the terrain. A person who is sure-footed is thus 
unlikely to slip or stumble.</p>
<p>On many hiking trails and mountain tours, sure-footedness is assumed to be a 
prerequisite without ever being defined. The term is frequently used in the 
literature presumably to ensure that the reader is made sufficiently aware that, 
under certain circumstances, one false step may lead to serious consequences.</p>
<p>Although there is no standard definition of sure-footedness,<span>&nbsp;</span>the 
following is a list of attributes that, as a rule, constitute what is generally 
meant:</p>
<ul>
				<li>Possession of sufficient coordination to progress over 
				uneven ground as intended, without losing one&#39;s<span>&nbsp;</span>balance. 
				That also includes being able to compensate for small slips when 
				moving forward, without any serious consequences.</li>
				<li>Correct assessment of the ground, both in terms of usable 
				footholds or steps and also the level of grip they afford. One 
				must be able to do this on all types of terrain, including<span>&nbsp;</span>scree,<span>&nbsp;</span>rock,<span>&nbsp;</span>schrofen, 
				bare earth or<span>&nbsp;</span>firn, and also in wet conditions.</li>
				<li>An ability to recognise those parts of the route which need 
				to be negotiated with particular care due to the risk of 
				falling.</li>
				<li>Proper assessment of one&#39;s own level of coordination and 
				ability, even when tired, in order to adjust one&#39;s rate of 
				progress accordingly. Experience has shown that sure-footedness 
				decreases in the afternoon due to physical and mental fatigue.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sure-footedness is something that one can be trained in to a certain extent, 
especially through regular, strenuous exercise in steep, rough terrain that is 
not exposed. In the early phases hiking sticks can be helpful. However, too 
great a reliance on them can be detrimental to sure-footedness when crossing 
terrain where they are of no use—as for example on protected rock sections. On 
the other hand, hiking poles can be invaluable, especially for older hikers, and 
those with knee problems, and as well provide added security where a stumble 
might be hazardous, on uneven ground or an exposed path.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Backcountry<span>&nbsp;</span>avalanches<span>&nbsp;</span>are generally triggered by 
the immediate action of the party.<span>&nbsp;</span>Precautions include training, 
monitoring weather conditions to learn the history of the<span>&nbsp;</span>snow 
pack, digging<span>&nbsp;</span>hasty pits, modifying the route, passing one-by-one 
through dangerous areas, wearing<span>&nbsp;</span>avalanche beacons, and carrying<span>&nbsp;</span>avalanche 
probes<span>&nbsp;</span>and<span>&nbsp;</span>snow shovels.<span>&nbsp;</span>Other 
non-avalanche snow immersions can be similarly dangerous, including<span>&nbsp;</span>tree 
wells.</p>
<p>Other mass movements include<span>&nbsp;</span>icefalls,<span>&nbsp;</span>landslides, 
and<span>&nbsp;</span>rockfalls.<span>&nbsp;</span>When choosing a campsite care must be 
taken to avoid those along with dead trees,<span>&nbsp;</span>snags, trees with large 
dead branches, or trees that have previously been through a<span>&nbsp;</span>forest 
fire. Collectively, these are called &quot;widowmakers&quot; by experienced campers.</p>
<p>Slips may occur:</p>
<ul>
				<li>On wet rocks or logs.</li>
				<li>When crossing streams, rivers, lakes, and other bodies of 
				water, which can be dangerous due to poor visibility, uneven 
				surfaces, smooth and<span>&nbsp;</span>algae<span>&nbsp;</span>or<span>&nbsp;</span>moss-covered 
				rocks, and strong currents. The tops of waterfalls are 
				especially dangerous because of fast moving water and smooth, 
				slanted rocks. Rubber soles grip poorly on slime, compared to 
				felt soles, crampons, or hob-nailed boots. Precautions include 
				being aware of the danger, using hiking poles, loosening packs 
				straps to lower gravity and in case of becoming submerged, and 
				crossing with other people linked arm to arm or using a rope.</li>
				<li>Because of loose material. Loose gravel or scree on top of 
				smooth rock acts like<span>&nbsp;</span>ball bearings. Precautions 
				include spotting the situation ahead, keeping knees bent and 
				weight forward, using hiking sticks, and brushing aside the 
				gravel where possible.</li>
				<li>Ice</li>
</ul>
<p>When travelling over<span>&nbsp;</span>glaciers,<span>&nbsp;</span>crevasses<span>&nbsp;</span>pose 
a grave danger.<span>&nbsp;</span>These giant cracks in the ice are not always 
visible, as snow can be blown and freeze over the top to make a<span>&nbsp;</span>snowbridge. 
At times snowbridges can be as thin as a few inches. Climbers and hikers use 
ropes to protect themselves from such hazards. Basic gear for glacier travel 
includes<span>&nbsp;</span>crampons<span>&nbsp;</span>and<span>&nbsp;</span>ice axes, and teams 
of two to five tie into a rope equally spaced. If someone begins to fall the 
other members of the team perform a<span>&nbsp;</span>self-arrest<span>&nbsp;</span>to 
stop the fall and then attempt a rescue.</p>
<p>Drownings<span>&nbsp;</span>are especially likely when accompanied by head 
injuries (which may render people unconscious), in very cold water (which can 
sap energy quickly), or in<span>&nbsp;</span>white water<span>&nbsp;</span>(which may be 
so frothy that it is impossible to float, or even swim, to the surface).</p>
<p>When walking beaches or crossing<span>&nbsp;</span>estuaries, it is essential to 
be aware of the tides.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Losing the way</h4>
<p>Travelers may become lost, either if a group cannot find its way or if an 
individual becomes separated from the party and cannot find it again. Lost 
hikers who cannot find their way to their destination on time may run out of 
food and water, or experience a change in weather. The absence of clearly marked 
trails increases the risk of losing one&#39;s way.</p>
<p>If a group splits up into several subgroups moving at different speeds, one 
of the subgroups may take a wrong turn at a trail junction. A common procedure 
to avoid this is for the leaders to stop at junctions and wait for the others. 
Keeping the group together is important in the wilderness, especially when 
visibility is blocked due to weather, rocks, or trees.</p>
<p>Carrying a map and compass, and knowing how to use them, will decrease the 
risk of getting lost. Likewise, a Global Positioning System may prove 
invaluable, as it can pinpoint a traveler&#39;s location, revealing his exact 
position and the direction to roads, services, and inhabited areas. Most GPS 
devices can also be designed to mark one&#39;s path on a map, making it easy to 
backtrack. Family Radio Service, General Mobile Radio Service, and amateur 
radios operating on the &quot;2 meters&quot; band may help maintain communication. 
Flashing lights, signal mirrors, and whistles are low-tech emergency signals.
</p>
<p>Without a distant focal point, such as a mountain top, or the sun or moon, 
people who are lost can sometimes wander in circles.</p>
<h4>Hazardous bystanders</h4>
<p><br />
Individuals encountered in the outdoors may not always be friendly and in some 
cases may pose a danger to outdoor recreationalists. These can take the case of 
robberies, sexual assault, or other attacks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Wild animals </h4>
<p>In many areas, adventurers may encounter large predatory animals such as 
bears or cougars. These animals rarely seek out humans as food, but they will 
attack under some conditions. Some hazardous encounters occur when animals raid 
human property for food. Additionally, if travelers come upon an unsuspecting 
animal and surprise it, it may attack. Regularly making loud noise, such as by 
clapping or yelling, reduces the risk of surprising an animal. Some people use 
bear bells as noisemakers, but these are usually too quiet to be heard from far 
away. Any mammal infected with rabies may behave unexpectedly, even 
aggressively, and could infect a human with rabies by biting. </p>
<p>Venomous animals, including snakes, scorpions, spiders and bees, may cause 
harm either directly or through anaphylactic shock. Overall, the greatest danger 
is often from insects, such as mosquitoes, ticks and fleas, which carry 
communicable diseases. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Specific accidents and ailments</h3>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h4>Metabolic imbalances</h4>
<p>Metabolic imbalances can affect general functioning and lead to other 
injuries.</p>
<ul>
				<li>Dehydration<span>&nbsp;</span>can rapidly incapacitate an 
				adventurer, especially in warm weather. In conditions of low 
				humidity, sweat evaporates so quickly that a person may not 
				notice the water loss. Carrying and drinking an adequate amount 
				of water helps avoid dehydration.<span>&nbsp;</span>Depending on 
				conditions, two liters of water may be enough for a day hike, 
				but under hot conditions (such as hiking the<span>&nbsp;</span>Grand 
				Canyon<span>&nbsp;</span>in summer), one liter<span>&nbsp;</span>per hour<span>&nbsp;</span>may 
				be required.<span>&nbsp;</span>Naturally occurring water is often 
				unfit to drink (see<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potability_of_backcountry_water" title="Potability of backcountry water">Potability 
				of backcountry water</a>).</li>
				<li>Sweating removes not only water, but also salt. This may 
				result in a deficiency of<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium" title="Sodium">sodium</a><span>&nbsp;</span>(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyponatremia" title="Hyponatremia">hyponatremia</a>). 
				Eating salty snacks together with drinking water helps to avoid 
				this problem.</li>
				<li>If deprived of food for several days, travelers may become<span>&nbsp;</span>malnourished. 
				Malnutrition takes several weeks to kill a person, but because 
				it impairs judgment, it can cause problems much sooner.<span>&nbsp;</span>Low 
				blood sugar<span>&nbsp;</span>may have a similar effect, especially 
				for those with<span>&nbsp;</span>diabetes. Carrying extra food will 
				minimize risk to the hiker.</li>
				<li>Hypothermia<span>&nbsp;</span>is a potentially fatal drop in core 
				body temperature. It occurs most easily in cold weather and when 
				wet. Wet or damp clothing (due to rain, sweat, stream crossings, 
				etc.) can bring it on even in relatively warm air, particularly 
				at high elevation, windy conditions, or at low humidity. Even if 
				hypothermia does not kill the victim directly it causes 
				confusion, irrationality and impaired judgment, increasing the 
				risk of other injuries.<span>&nbsp;</span>Sufficient clothing helps 
				prevent hypothermia, but some materials (especially<span>&nbsp;</span>cotton) 
				are discouraged because they absorb and hold water.</li>
				<li>Heat exhaustion, possibly developing into<span>&nbsp;</span>heatstroke, 
				can occur in hot weather, particularly if one is dehydrated or 
				dressed too warmly. The risk of heatstroke can be minimized by 
				avoiding direct sun, and staying wet when possible. This is a 
				life-threatening condition: a victim must be cooled off and 
				transported to a hospital immediately.</li>
				<li>Altitude sickness<span>&nbsp;</span>results from climbing rapidly 
				to elevations beyond 2,500 metres (approximately 8,000 feet). 
				The process of acclimatization generally takes several days, but 
				may be helped by drugs, such as<span>&nbsp;</span>Diamox. Acute 
				mountain sickness (AMS) may develop into<span>&nbsp;</span>high 
				altitude pulmonary edema<span>&nbsp;</span>(HAPE) or<span>&nbsp;</span>high 
				altitude cerebral edema<span>&nbsp;</span>(HACE), both of which are 
				life-threatening and require immediate transportation to a lower 
				altitude.</li>
				<li>Carbon monoxide poisoning<span>&nbsp;</span>may occur in tents, 
				igloos, cabins, or trailers due to faulty or misused equipment.<span>&nbsp;</span>It 
				may also occur near the exhausts of motorboats, where the CO 
				concentrations can be high enough to be quickly fatal.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id="Topical_injuries">Topical injuries</span></h4>
<ul>
				<li>Frostbite<span>&nbsp;</span>can occur when bare skin is exposed 
				to very low temperatures.<span>&nbsp;</span>Frostbite can be 
				prevented by adequate clothing.</li>
				<li>Sunburn, which may occur in hot or cold conditions, can be 
				debilitating.<span>&nbsp;</span>Sunburn may be prevented by wearing 
				adequate<span>&nbsp;</span>sunscreen.</li>
				<li>Snow blindness, a burning of the<span>&nbsp;</span>cornea, is 
				caused by the intense ultraviolet solar radiation multiplied by 
				sunlit snow.<span lang="en-us"> </span>Snow blindness may be 
				prevented by wearing dark sunglasses or goggles.</li>
				<li>Burns<span>&nbsp;</span>can occur when dealing with camp stoves. 
				Boiling pots are overturned, clogged fuel lines explode, hot 
				metal is touched with bare skin. Burns are also caused by<span>&nbsp;</span>campfires, 
				cookfires and<span>&nbsp;</span>bonfires.</li>
				<li>Lacerations<span>&nbsp;</span>may be caused by careless use of 
				knives or axes, or contact with sharp rocks or barbed wire.<span>&nbsp;</span>Tetanus<span>&nbsp;</span>and 
				other infections can result.</li>
				<li>Poisonous plants, such as<span>&nbsp;</span>poison ivy<span>&nbsp;</span>or<span>&nbsp;</span>stinging 
				nettle, cause<span>&nbsp;</span>rashes.</li>
				<li>Plant thorns<span>&nbsp;</span>and<span>&nbsp;</span>animal quills<span>&nbsp;</span>can 
				cause deep puncture<span>&nbsp;</span>wounds, and can be difficult to 
				remove, often requiring pliers.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Internal injuries</h4>
<p><br />
When combined with lack of proper physical conditioning, cumbersome backpacks 
increase the risk of missteps and falls, particularly on difficult terrain. Poor 
judgment due to exhaustion or inattention on steep or slippery slopes can also 
lead to injury. </p>
<ul>
				<li>Ankle sprain is a common and debilitating injury. Proper 
				hiking boots can help prevent it.</li>
				<li>Foot blisters are caused by friction and irritation of the 
				skin. Wet socks and poorly fitting shoes precipitate the 
				occurrence of blisters. Two layers of socks (using liner socks) 
				help prevent blisters, and moleskin can be applied to 
				blister-prone areas as a treatment or preventive measure.</li>
				<li>Back injury may result from packing more than one can carry 
				or not having a proper backpack. A pack for backpacking should 
				be bought from a recreational store, and as a rule of thumb, a 
				person who is not overweight can comfortably carry up to one 
				third of his or her body weight; however a backpack weighing 
				more than 50 pounds (23 kg) should be avoided. Hiking poles may 
				also reduce the likelihood of back injuries by spreading the 
				load across multiple points. Care should be taken to lift and 
				put on the pack with the least strain.</li>
</ul>
<h4><br />
Digestive infections</h4>
<p><br />
Surface water in the wilderness can contain viruses, bacteria or parasites. The 
latter two can cause dysentery or wilderness diarrhea in untreated water and can 
be spread person-to-person by poor hygiene in camp. The most common cause of 
wilderness diarrhea is the parasite Giardia.<span lang="en-us">&nbsp;</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilderness-acquired_diarrhea">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilderness-acquired_diarrhea</a><span lang="en-us"> </span>

<h2>Ten Essentials</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Essentials"> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Essentials</a></p>
<p>The Ten Essentials are survival items that hiking and Scouting organizations 
recommend for safe travel in the backcountry. </p>
<p>The Ten Essentials first appeared in print in the third edition of 
Mountaineering: The Freedom of the Hills (January 1974). Many regional 
organizations and authors recommend that hikers, backpackers, and climbers 
rigorously ensure they have the ten essentials with them. However, personal 
preferences and differences in conditions may dictate otherwise and with 
experience most adventurers add and subtract from the list depending on the 
situation. Some ultralight backpackers do not always carry all of the items and 
believe it is an acceptable risk they take in order to travel light and fast</p>
<h3><span lang="en-us">Main list</span></h3>
<p>According to the eighth edition of Mountaineering: The Freedom of the Hills 
(2010) book there are ten essentials.</p>
<ol>
				<li>Navigation. Topographic map and assorted maps in waterproof 
				container plus a magnetic compass, optional altimeter or GPS 
				receiver.</li>
				<li>Sun protection. Sunglasses, sunscreen for lips and skin, 
				hat, clothing for sun protection.</li>
				<li>Insulation. Jacket, hat, gloves, rain shell, and thermal 
				underwear.</li>
				<li>Illumination. Headlamp, flashlight, batteries. LED bulb is 
				preferred to extend battery life.</li>
				<li>First-aid supplies, plus insect repellent.</li>
				<li>Fire. Butane lighter, matches in waterproof container.</li>
				<li>Repair kit and tools. Knives,<span>&nbsp;</span>multi-tool, 
				scissors, pliers, screwdriver, trowel/shovel, duct tape, cable 
				ties.</li>
				<li>Nutrition. Add extra food for one additional day (for 
				emergency). Dry food is preferred to save weight and usually 
				needs water.</li>
				<li>Hydration. Add extra 2 liters of water for one additional 
				day (for emergency).</li>
				<li>Emergency shelter. Tarp,<span>&nbsp;</span>bivouac sack,<span>&nbsp;</span>space 
				blanket, plastic tube tent, jumbo trash bags, insulated sleeping 
				pad.</li>
</ol>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This book recommends supplementing the above with: </p>
<ul>
				<li>Portable water purification and water bottles</li>
				<li>Ice axe for glacier or snowfield travel (if necessary)</li>
				<li>Signaling devices, such as a whistle, mobile phone, two-way 
				radio, satellite phone, unbreakable signal mirror or flare, 
				laser pointer.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Other lists</h3>
<p>Other outdoor organizations have variations of the Ten Essentials pertinent 
to local conditions. </p>
<p>Boy Scouts of America&#39;s &quot;Scout Basic Essentials&quot; are quite similar (Map and 
Compass, Sun Protection, Extra Clothing, Flashlight, First-Aid Kit, Matches and 
Fire-starters, Pocketknife, Trail Food, Water Bottle, and Rain Gear.)</p>
<p>Utah&#39;s Wasatch Mountain Club lists extra water in place of food, as Utah is 
mostly desert terrain, and water is more difficult to find.</p>
<p>The Spokane Mountaineers list &quot;thirteen essentials&quot;, which supplement the 
list with emergency shelter such as a space blanket, signaling device, and 
toilet paper and trowel (for sanitary disposal of human waste; the toilet paper 
also doubles as tinder for starting a fire).</p>
<p>The &quot;Ten Essential Groups&quot; is an alternative approach to essential gear 
selection.[8] Items from each group should be chosen depending on the season, 
geographic location, and trip duration. In 2011, Columbia Sportswear adopted the 
&quot;Ten Essential Groups&quot; concept for their iOS app &quot;Take Ten to the Greater 
Outdoors&quot;. </p>
<p>Central Arizona Mountain Rescue Association promotes the 12 Essentials, which 
includes Signaling Devices and Personal Items</p>

<font size="4"><b>The aim of the Tyrol Declaration for mountain sports</b></font><span>&nbsp;</span><br />
is to protect the freedom of participants and promote social development, 
cultural understanding and environmental awareness. To this end, the Tyrol 
Declaration follows the traditional unwritten values and codes of conduct 
inherent in mountain sports and expands on these to meet the demands of our 
times. These proposals for best practice in mountain sports are adressed to all 
lovers of the mountains worldwide - whether they be hikers and trekkers, sport 
climbers, or mountaineers seeking to push their limits at high altitudes. With 
these proposals we especially hope to reach young people, for they are the 
future of mountain sports.</p>

<b><i>Human dignity</i></b><br />
In keeping with Article 1 of the UN Bill of Human Rights, the proposals are 
based on the premise that human beings are born free and equal in dignity and 
rights and should treat one another in the spirit of brotherhood. Particular 
attention should be given to equal rights of men and women.</p>

<b><i>Life, liberty, happiness</i></b><br />
Is goes without saying that climbers and mountaineers subscribe to the 
inalienable human rights, foremost life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. 
We feel a special responsibility towards the indigenious populations of mountain 
areas, whose right to a dignified, self-determined life must be protected by all 
possible means.</p>

<b><i>Intactness of nature</i></b><br />
Thanks to their intensive contact with nature, climbers and alpinists develop 
awareness for the beauty of a healthy environment and the need to preserve its 
flora and fauna. &quot;Leave no traces&quot; has always been a key issue in our 
environmental philosophy. With the growing threat to fragile ecosystems in 
mountain regions all over the world, one of the most important commitments of 
the climbing community has become the protection of endangered species of flora 
and fauna, both in the mountains and in crag climbing areas.</p>

<b><i>Solidarity</i></b><br />
There are few situations in which people are so dependent on each other as are 
climbers on hard routes in wilderness areas. Rewarding experiences and success 
most readily manifest in a harmonious team where mutual support is the rule. The 
shared experience of intensive outdoor adventure diminishes differences due to 
social class, age, religion or nationality. Thus, climbing has become a means to 
promote understanding among individuals as well as nations. Solidarity between 
hikers, rock climbers and mountaineers also extends to the population of the 
regions they visit.</p>

<b><i>Self-actualization</i></b><br />
It is our conviction that all humans - after their immediate physical demands 
and their needs for security, love and recognition have been met - strive for 
self-actualization. For millions of people around the world, climbing and 
mountaineering have become a significant factor in the quest for a meaningful 
life. It is through climbing that they experience the support of a friendly 
social environment, recognition and the exhilarating pleasures of athletic 
accomplishment.</p>

<b><i>Truth</i></b><br />
As performance in climbing frequently goes unwitnessed and often can&#39;t be 
indisputably documented, experts and the public alike have to rely on the 
truthfulness of the activists who report on their accomplishments. If 
arbitrariness replaces truth, it becomes impossible to evaluate performance in 
climbing, thus robbing our sport of one of its most important motives.</p>

<b><i>Excellence</i></b><br />
All mountaineers and rock climbers like to tackle problems that challenge them 
both physically and mentally, striving for both elegant and controlled execution 
of the task. Many activists strive to improve their abilities. Without continual 
progress on the cutting edge of performance, climbing would lose much of its 
dynamism and fascination.</p>

<b><i>Adventure</i></b><br />
We experience our own performance most intensively when - moving close to our 
limits - we interact with the natural obstacles posed by mountains or crags as 
directly as possible, with a minimum of interfering technology. For this reason, 
risk and advantage are essential factors in climbing. The intensive feeling of 
satisfaction climbing can impart, is a product of the exiting balance between 
danger and safety achieved through skillfully blending courage, rational 
judgment, emotional control, responsibility and athletic prowess. The diversity 
of disciplines in mountain sports - hiking, adventure climbing and sport/plaisir 
climbing - allows everyone to chose their own individual adventure, where their 
skills and the dangers are in balance.</p>

<b>The quality of values</b><br />
Although individualistic values play an essential role in defining climbing, we 
need to realize that in any moral issue, these rank below humane principles and 
environmentally-oriented ideals. Putting self-actualization, performance and 
adventure above the right to life of Man and his natural environment is 
incompatible with the humanistic values of mountaineering and rock climbing. It 
is the responsibilty of every single climber to weigh and balance the values of 
his sport so that climbing can keep its integrity and is able to stand up 
against current trends marked by shortsightedness, egotism and greed.</p>
