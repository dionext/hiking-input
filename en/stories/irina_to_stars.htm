<h1>History of irina.to.stars - 4000 km Pacific Crest Trail (USA)</h1>
<p><br />
Having placed the description of the film "Wild" in the top of our rating, could 
we have assumed that in a few months we would be able to meet a Russian girl who 
could well be the prototype of the main character of the film (of course, with 
the amendment that the film "Wild" already had real prototype in the USA)?</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;The acquaintance happened quite by accident at a tourist rally by a common 
fire, when everyone in turn began to tell their stories, one girl modestly said: 
“I have covered four thousand kilometers of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Crest_Trail"> 
Pacific Crest Trail (PCT)</a>”. The story (so far in the form of diary entries) 
can be read on her instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/irina.to.stars/">
https://www.instagram.com/irina.to.stars/</a><span lang="en-us"> </span>&nbsp;We, 
of course, were primarily interested in initial motivations, what were the life 
problems that pushed a person to this the hardest way? And of course, has this 
journey become the turning point in life that would give a person the strength 
to resolve these problems? On Irina's instagram, her life story and 
philosophical reflections are united by the corresponding tags

<p class="MsoNormal">Each reader can draw his own conclusions on this score, and 
here we will share ours with you.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Alas, but modern industrial civilization often drives 
people into an absolute dead end in life, completely depriving their lives of 
meaningful fullness ("existential vacuum" in terms of psychologist and 
philosopher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Frankl">V. Frankl</a>). 
There are two ways to get out of this impasse (to be in which for a long time is 
destructive for a person): to step down one step or step up one step. And not so 
much in the intellectual as in the worldview.<span lang="en-us"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the first case (step down), a person simply suppresses 
the desire to understand what I am and who I am, and in the future lives 
according to a primitive robotic scheme. Which can be conventionally called 
"home - work". At the same time, he does not cease to be human and also 
contributes to human civilization. But the question is - is this "contribution" 
adequate to its strengths and capabilities? Not to mention the fact that in this 
way a person puts an end to his inner development.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The second way is, of course, a step upward along the path 
of enriching our life with that semantic content that best suits the forces and 
capabilities given to us by nature, as well as the knowledge gained as a result 
of reading books and numerous hours we spent on school benches and institutes. 
audiences.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">And in order to make this very “step up” many (though not 
all) people necessarily need some kind of “tool” to break through the vicious 
circle of everyday life. Such a "tool" can be easily found if you look in the 
direction of hiking<span lang="en-us"> </span>and mountain tourism, etc. - that 
is, all those activities that are associated with overcoming oneself, overcoming 
external difficulties and hardening one's own character.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This tool can be useful for many people. The only 
difference is that someone does not necessarily need to go 4000 km of the way, 
and maybe 400 km is enough to shake things up, or even 40 km is enough. Although 
4 km will probably not be enough. However, they are also useful for further 
maintaining the tone.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Hiking, among other things, provides a good opportunity to 
be alone with yourself, to reflect on life. This is if you go alone. Or chat 
with people who may have similar motivations. This is if you go as part of a 
group. However, both of these possibilities can be combined. An example of which 
are Irina's diary entries. Although she walked the PCT alone (six months!), As 
she passed the route, she constantly crossed paths with different people, part 
of the life stories that are posted on her instagram.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Next, we will give a number of points (quotes) from Irina's 
story, which seemed to us to be key for understanding its essence. Although, of 
course, we do not pretend that we have fully reached this understanding :).</p>
<h2>Before the PCT. Biography</h2>
• I grew up in an ordinary Soviet family, with Soviet attitudes and lack of 
money ... My parents gave me the best education - free mathematics ... As a 
child I was a downtrodden girl and the path to at least some kind of awareness 
was very long and arduous .. I already have an adult child - the best daughter 
in the world. There was a promising office job. A roof over your head, family 
and comfort.<br />
• I have been working in an office for 4.5 years ... I dreamed of this kind of 
work for a long time, sitting on a prolonged maternity leave ... Then it was my 
first office job ... I grew up enough in the career ladder, received a good 
salary , interesting complex projects ... Probably for many - this is a dream 
... but! The work did not bring pleasure specifically to me ... something was 
not right ... I could not understand what, but I realized that something needed 
to be changed ...<br />
• At home - a relationship that has lasted for 14 years ... This is a huge 
period, but the further, the more I realized that we are completely different in 
outlook on life, in goals, in desires, in dreams ... It was hard for me to 
decide and leave ... family is the most sacred for me.<br />
• We have one life and I finally have a crazy plan: I leave work - I fill the 
free 8 hours with what will bring pleasure, “my friends” - I rent an apartment 
and move with my daughter from my husband - I return back to the office ... 
about all 5 months ... But something went wrong ... I quit my job, moved to my 
apartment (even if it was rented, but my own), and I could not go back to the 
office to work ... not mine? thought ... what then is mine ???<br />
<h2>What tasks did she solve on the PCT:<br />
</h2>
• I am able to bring the matter to the end (clearly set goal = result)<br />
• I understand the value of myself<br />
• I learn to see which goals are real at the moment<br />
• I build my boundaries and know how to see and protect myself from addiction 
and manipulation<br />
• I change my attitude to situations: to addiction, who is my environment and 
what is it for me, how does it affect me?<br />
• I try to write a book to get feedback and errors cannot be transferred to the 
printed version<br />
• Just writing - I am learning to structure my thoughts into words. I convey 
them to others and convey to the reader in the form in which they live in my 
head<br />
• Collect stories "why are they on the PCT?"<h2>PCT</h2>
• Yesterday I walked again without water, like only 9 km, but in the very heat, 
without wind and shadow Glitches began - I saw an evil human grinning face in 
the tree, everywhere I saw people instead of bushes ... the last kilometer - my 
mouth was dry, I could hardly move my legs ... muttered constantly: "water, 
water ..."<br />
• It took me a month and a half to understand how you can move in the heat, get 
used to the loads and start walking at least 30 km every day ... to understand 
that I no longer want to wander in the desert, or at least not in the summer and 
not for long ... favorite mountains - I think the best part of the path for me 
...<br />
• I watch hikers: someone goes and listens to music with headphones, someone 
turns it on at full volume, someone hums songs himself ... I love to listen to 
nature ...<br />
• Today I remembered the true attitude towards you manifests itself in 
difficulties ... when everything is fine with you, people are drawn to you, they 
want to communicate, they play with you. And as soon as trouble happens and you 
need help - where are all those "acquaintances"? - scored, dissolved and threw 
all the memories in the trash ... Games! I hate it...<br />
• Observing others, I began to notice my own behavior ... You say one thing, but 
in reality you behave completely differently. I began to understand why people 
do not treat me the way I would like ...<br />
• Discovery: I learned to be happy and take care of others And this is the merit 
of trailangel. I used to be an independent woman - never take from others, 
everything myself. Oh wow, this is "all by herself" But when you see the 
kindness from the trailangel, sincere (when nothing is asked back), then you 
break into a smile and accept the gift with joy, also with an open heart. 
Sometimes I notice in others the same problems that were in me - when I see a 
hiker passing by and not receiving a gift from the trailangel ... Not all 
trailangels are sincere, there are also strange ones and expecting a response 
from you (more often money). On the contrary, Bill - who treats hikers with 
unlimited fruit and water every day. Could this be fake? Or a woman who gave a 
ride to the city and did not charge for gasoline. This is a sincere concern from 
a pure heart. The whole attitude is felt - that's enough ...<br />
<h2>What did you get on the PCT? Outcome</h2>
• Ability to see the world wider - there is no limit to the possibilities.<br />
• We are all different, but we can all learn everything. Everyone has their own 
abilities and their own pace, but this is not an obstacle, these are just your 
features. Everything is decided: work, steps, aspirations, actions, luck, chance 
and time.<br />
• Time is the most valuable resource, money cannot buy it.<br />
• The past cannot be changed, it is impossible to erase what has already 
happened. This can only be accepted, both in yourself and in others. Realize and 
move on.<div>

				<div tabindex="0">
					<span lang="en">• Not a single situation, not one of your 
					experiences can predict your future. All actions, thoughts, 
					feelings - all this is only within the boundaries of a 
					particular person and they can be anything. They may not 
					obey common sense, logic, statistics. They are just their 
					own. You cannot influence another person. It only remains to 
					accept.<br />
					• We are not insured against anything in life. There is no 
					100% guarantee. Everything that is happening now is already 
					happening. And we shape the future ourselves and also now.<br />
					• Live in the moment: here and now!<br />
					• You are free ... free in your choice and only you can 
					decide which choice to make<br />
					• Our nature is not dangerous. She was given to help us. Her 
					beauties are endless and only we can decide how much we are 
					able to open our eyes.<br />
					• Nothing just happens - everything is given to us for 
					something. Everything in life has a price. You need to rely 
					only on yourself, take responsibility for what is happening 
					and move on ...<br />
					<br />
					I'm not perfect, but I'm alive and I see value in it</span></div>
