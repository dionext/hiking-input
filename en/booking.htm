<h2>Mountain huts</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>A mountain hut (also known as alpine hut, mountain shelter, mountain 
refuge, mountain lodge, and mountain hostel) is a building located high in the 
mountains, generally accessible only by foot, intended to provide food and 
shelter to mountaineers, climbers and hikers. Mountain huts are usually operated 
by an Alpine Club or some organisation dedicated to hiking or mountain 
recreation. Mountain huts can provide a range of services, starting with shelter 
and simple sleeping berths. Some, particularly in remote areas, are not staffed, 
but others have staff which prepare meals and drinks and can provide other 
services, including providing lectures and selling clothing and small items. 
Mountain huts usually allow anybody to access their facilities, although some 
require reservations.<br />

<p>Unfortunately, for today there is no<span lang="en-us"> </span>uniform system of booking of places in mountain 
<span lang="en-us">huts</span> like similar for hotels, <span lang="en-us">
hostels</span> or campings.<span lang="en-us"> </span>Therefore to reserve spending the night in such 
<span lang="en-us">huts</span> it is necessary to learn independently its 
<span lang="en-us">contacts</span> (phone), to call up and agree.&nbsp;However<span lang="en-us"> 
</span>gradually rudiments of similar systems appear.</p>

<h2>Independent residing at tents </h2>
<p>As a rule, in all <span lang="en-us">&nbsp;</span>countries you can live in the tent, stopping in specially taken away campings.<span lang="en-us"> 
</span>It<span lang="en-us"> will be not free</span>, but essentially is cheaper than residing at hotel.&nbsp;Possibility of independent residing in tent out of кемпинговых zones strongly depends on the concrete country and region.&nbsp;In the Central Europe it is ordinary is not welcomed, though it is sometimes supposed above forest level. And here, for example, in Norway laws more liberal.&nbsp;More concrete information needs to be learnt in the tourist centres of regions.&nbsp;</p>
