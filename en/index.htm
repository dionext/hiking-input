<span lang="en-us">Hiking</span> is also an excellent way to plunge into the nature for one day and an easy adventure, which you can spend on days off to leave from city vanity and to freshen yourselves till the morning on Monday. </p>
<p>In <span lang="en-us">hiking</span> we are involved with absence of necessity always to fill silence with words. You do not need to speak anything when you lie under stars or look in deep mountain gorge. Thus you have a feeling of surprise, extensiveness and sense.</p>
