<h2>Naturism, nudists, &quot;savages&quot; </h2>
<p>Naturism - one of the modern world outlook currents, which basic idea - the maximum approach of the person to the nature for body and spirit improvement. </p>
<blockquote>Naturism, or nudism, is a cultural and political movement 
				practicing, advocating, and defending personal and social 
				nudity, most but not all of which takes place on private 
				property. The term may also refer to a lifestyle based on 
				personal, family, or social nudity.[1] Naturism may take a 
				number of forms. It may be practiced individually, within a 
				family, socially, or in public. Additionally, there is also 
				militant naturism, including campaigning, and extreme naturism 
				is sometimes considered a separate category. <br />

<span><br /> Savages - it is formal, it is the human civilisation standing at a 
low step of development, in a primeval condition. However from an easy hand of 
some writers this word began to be used in metaphorical sense for a world outlook designation, in something close to a naturism.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<h2>Hippie </h2>
<blockquote> A hippie&nbsp; is a member of the counterculture of the 1960s, 
				originally a youth movement that began in the United States 
				during the mid-1960s and spread to other countries around the 
				world. The word hippie came from hipster and was used to 
				describe beatniks who moved into New York City&#39;s Greenwich 
				Village and San Francisco&#39;s Haight-Ashbury district. The term 
				hippie first found popularity in San Francisco with Herb Caen, 
				who was a journalist for the San Francisco Chronicle. <br/>				
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippie">
				https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippie</a></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Normally it is considered that hippies trust in following positions:</p>
<ul>
				<li>The person should be<span>&nbsp;</span>free;</li>
				<li>To reach freedom it is possible, only having changed an inner system of soul;</li>
				<li>Acts of internally unchained person are defined by aspiration to preserve the freedom as the greatest jewelry;</li>
				<li>The beauty and freedom are identical each other and that realisation of that and another&nbsp;— purely spiritual problem;</li>
				<li>All who divide told above, form a spiritual community;</li>
				<li>Spiritual community&nbsp;— the ideal form of a hostel;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>The hippie is the specific subgroup of the subculture which have arisen in the USA in the early sixties of the XX-th century which has quickly extended on all countries of the world, and has practically disappeared to the middle of the seventieth. In the original of hippie were a part of the youth movement consisting almost completely from white teenagers and enough of young adults at the age from fifteen to twenty five, which have inherited cultural revolt from bohemia and beatniks. Hippies with contempt concerned the settled concepts, criticised values of middle class and acted as radical opposition to application of the nuclear weapon, war in Vietnam. They have made popular and have shined aspects of the religions which are distinct from a Judaism and Christianity almost unknown at that point in time. Hippies have literally pushed sexual revolution; they encouraged the use of psychodelic junks on purpose to expand human consciousness. Hippies created original communes where their values were cultivated. <br/><a href="http://www.sub-culture.ru/hippy.php"> http://www.sub-culture.ru/hippy.php</a></blockquote>
<h2>Communards </h2>
<p>The Communard (with reference to a theme of our site) is the person who is the participant of a modern commune-settlement. </p>
<blockquote>A commune (the French word appearing in the 12th century from 
				Medieval Latin communia, meaning a large gathering of people 
				sharing a common life; from Latin communis, things held in 
				common) is an intentional community of people living together, 
				sharing common interests, often having common values and 
				beliefs, as well as shared property, possessions, resources, 
				and, in some communes, work, income or assets. In addition to 
				the communal economy, consensus decision-making, 
				non-hierarchical structures and ecological living have become 
				important core principles for many communes. There are many 
				contemporary intentional communities all over the world, a list 
				of which can be found at the Fellowship for Intentional 
				Community (FIC) <br/>

<h2><span lang="en-us">D</span>ownshifting</h2>
<blockquote> The term downshifting in the English language refers to the act of 
				reducing the gear ratio while driving a vehicle with manual 
				transmission. This title or term has now been re-purposed and 
				applied to describe a social behavior or trend in which 
				individuals live simpler lives to escape from what critics call 
				the rat race. The long-term effect of downshifting can include 
				an escape from what has been described as economic materialism, 
				as well as reduce the &quot;stress and psychological expense that may 
				accompany economic materialism&quot;. This new social trend 
				emphasizes finding an improved balance between leisure and work, 
				while also focusing life goals on personal fulfillment, as well 
				as building personal relationships instead of the all-consuming 
				pursuit of economic success. Down-shifting, as a concept, shares 
				many characteristics with simple living. However, it is 
				distinguished as an alternative form by its focus on moderate 
				change and concentration on an individual comfort level and a 
				gradual approach to living.[1] In the 1990s, this new form of 
				simple living began appearing in the mainstream media, and has 
				continually grown in popularity among populations living in 
				industrial societies, especially the United States, the United 
				Kingdom, New Zealand, and Australia, as well as Russia. <br/>

<h2><span lang="en-us">Hermit</span></h2>
<blockquote>A hermit (adjectival form: eremitic or hermitic) is a person who 
				lives in seclusion from society, usually for religious 
				reasons.[1][2][3] Hermits are a part of several sections of 
				Christianity, and the concept is found in other religions as 
				well. <br />
