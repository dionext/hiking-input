<h1>Cartography<span lang="en-us"> (maps)</span></h1>
<p>From our point of view, the map are the main organizational and inspiring means of the 
hiker. Also they can be used for entertainment :).&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>
<img src="../images/cards2.jpg" height="354"/></p>
<p> Further we result the survey of the most popular &nbsp;cartographical means and tools. The basic attention is given computer means that at all does not cancel for each tourist of necessity to have at itself and the paper map (the accumulator in which&nbsp;will never be discharged and will not bring you during the most necessary moment).&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;<img alt="" src="../images/pixabay/compass-3072364_640.jpg" height="354" /></p>
<p> In each section of means &nbsp;are sorted as their popularity and efficiency for the 
hikers (from our point of view). </p>
<h2> Paper maps </h2>
<p> Paper topographic maps can be got in bookshops, booths at stations and the airports, the local tourist<span lang="en-us"> 
offices </span>and in hotels where you live.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p> On the Alpine region the authoritative publisher of maps considers Kompass Karten. 
<span lang="en-us">It</span> is the Austrian publisher of maps who are based in Innsbruck who specialises 
on foot maps and guidebooks, digital maps, and also on bicycle maps and ​​ 
guidebooks. </p>
<p>KOMPASS has about 1,000 titles in its programme, including 700 hiking, 
cycling and ski touring maps. Just under 500 hiking maps have been published 
covering the hiking areas of Austria, South Tyrol, Germany, the Balearic and 
Canary Islands. Hiking regions in the rest of Italy, the Swiss Alps, the Czech 
Republic and Slovakia have some coverage. The maps are mainly published at a 
scale of 1:25,000 or 1:50,000, with trails, footpaths and additional tourist 
information highlighted. The new generation of hiking maps is printed with c 
coordinate grid for GPS navigation. Since mid-2011 weatherproof and 
rip-resistant maps have been printed, gradually replacing the existing maps. </p>
<p>KOMPASS-Verlag has just under fifty digital maps in its range, covering the 
whole of Austria, several walking areas in Germany, South Tyrol, the Canaries, 
the Balearics, Malta and Elba. The digital maps are usable on PDAs and mobile 
phones using Java technology for outdoor navigation. The map material is at a 
scale of 1:50,000 zoomable to 1:10,000. </p>
<p>Since 2009 there has been a cycling map series at a scale of 1:70,000. In 
2011 a cycling guide series appeared. Both are printed on rip-resistant and 
weatherproof paper. </p>
<p>The company also publishes hiking atlases, nature guides, panoramas, cookery 
books and ski tour guides.</p>

considered its primary output. The creation and growth of OSM has been motivated 
by restrictions on use or availability of map information across much of the 
world, and the advent of inexpensive portable satellite navigation devices.[6] 
OSM is considered a prominent example of volunteered geographic information.

<h2>GPS tracks</h2>
<img alt="" src="../images/pixabay/crossroads-1595989_640.jpg" width="640" height="590" /><br />
<p>The track&nbsp; <span lang="en-us"></span>is a sequence of points of GPS<span lang="en-us">
</span>coordinates with marks of time of their passage. As a rule, it is generated by special devices (navigators) or special 
<span lang="en-us">sofrtware</span> for <span lang="en-us">computers and 
smartphones</span>. That is, someone has passed a certain route with the included navigator who preserved every second current coordinates in a file. Such track can be loaded in the navigator or special 
<span lang="en-us">software for</span> <span lang="en-us">computers and 
smartphones</span> that then to pass the same route. There are public storehouses of tracks on the Internet where it is possible to look at the user tracks and to download them to themselves on the computer device. Also it is possible to load the track into the given storehouse to share it with tourist community.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Using a track for route passage, it is not necessary to forget that the track not always can coincide with an optimum route, and also not always coincide with available tracks&nbsp;and roads. In most cases such coincidence will take place, but not always. The tourist who has written down a track, could descend periodically from a track aside or even it could appear for some time in position &quot;lost the way&quot;. The track (especially it concerns mountain tracks) could change the thread eventually.&nbsp;All should be meant it. <br />
</p>
<p>Anyway, the analysis of another's tracks is useful at route planning.  </p>
<p>
<img alt="" src="../images/pixabay/globe-2707935_640.jpg" width="640" height="460" /><br />
</p>
<p>There are various formats for tracks. But many modern devices/on support loading of tracks in several formats. As a last resort always it is possible to use programs for &nbsp;converting from one format in another. <br />
</p>
<p>Popular formats are: &nbsp;GPX (GPS eXchange Format), TCX, KML and KMZ (Google Earth), PLT (a format of program OziExplorer), GDB (Garmin Mapsource) <br />

<p>HikingTrails is a windows desktop application to create/manage hiking trails 
and corresponding pictures. The mission of HikingTrails is to offer hikers and 
landscape/nature photographers a free (off-cloud) hiking application to do the 
following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Easily manage, build, edit and view hiking trails on a Bing Map. You can 
	draw routes in free draw mode or use the routing API (shortest distance/time 
	between two points). Two routing API's are supported: open route service API 
	(<a href="https://openrouteservice.org/" rel="nofollow">https://openrouteservice.org/</a>) 
	and the Bing Maps routes API. To use the routing functionality you need to 
	get a Bing Maps API key or an open route service API key (how to do this is 
	described in the help menu).</li>
	<li>To easily add point of interests with pictures to routes (you can import 
	geotagged pictures) and build a clear collection of geotagged hiking 
	pictures this way that is easily navigable and viewable.</li>
	<li>To share your routes with other users of HikingTrails and being able to 
	import existing hiking trails (KML/GPX file).</li>
</ul>
<p>The main functionalities are as followed:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Create/edit/view routes on a Bing Map (Bing Maps WPF control).</li>
	<li>Create routes in free draw mode or use the routing API (shortest 
	distance/time between two points). Two routing API's are supported: open 
	route service API (<a href="https://openrouteservice.org/" rel="nofollow">https://openrouteservice.org/</a>) 
	and the Bing Maps routes API. Used routing profiles: Bing Maps API -&gt; 
	'walking' , open route service API -&gt; 'foot-hiking'.</li>
	<li>Add points of interests to your route and include a description, tags, a 
	rating and a picture to each point of interest.</li>
	<li>For each route you can (among other things) enter a note, a category, 
	and a date.</li>
	<li>Save your routes as an XML file on your desktop computer/laptop.</li>
	<li>Export a route/routes to KML and open them in Google Earth. Or you can 
	also use the KML file in an offline navigation app like for example maps.me:<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://maps.me/" rel="nofollow">https://maps.me/</a>. 
	This way you can follow the route on your smartphone while walking.</li>
	<li>Export route/routes to XML (HikingTrails route file) and share them with 
	other users.</li>
	<li>Import routes from a KML or GPX file.</li>
	<li>Import routes from a HikingTrails route file (XML file).</li>
	<li>Import geo-tagged pictures as POI points from a folder or import a 
	geo-tagged picture file as POI point (this way you can easily couple your 
	photo's to a location along the hiking trail).</li>
	<li>View statistics of your routes.</li>
	<li>View all your walked routes on a calendar.</li>
	<li>Quickly browse through the images of all the point of interests of all 
	routes with the use of a treeview. Each route has an app data folder that 
	stores all the POI images of a route (the selected images are copied to this 
	folder and can then be geotagged).</li>
	<li>Geotag your hiking pictures.</li>
</ul>
