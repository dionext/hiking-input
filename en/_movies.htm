<h1>Films about tourism</h1>
<p>We have collected a selection of descriptions of films which, in our opinion, could be interesting
<span lang="en-us">for</span> <span lang="en-us">hikers</span>. In this selection are collected not only the films completely devoted to the 
<span lang="en-us">hiking</span>. Such films (where heroes all film walk along 
the trail<span lang="en-us">)</span>, generally speaking, not so that much. Perhaps, the most classical representative of the given genre is the film <a href="../media/Wild">&quot;Wild&quot;</a>, but it is faster an exception to the rules<span lang="en-us">.</span> &nbsp;Therefore we did not begin to limit ourselves&nbsp; and have collected a collection of descriptions of films which 
concern tourism in general<span lang="en-us">.</span></p>
<p>The most of these films can quite be considered &quot;inspiring&quot; for any
<span lang="en-us">hikers</span>.&nbsp;Or they simply will help to 
<span lang="en-us">spend</span> time in the evening or during journey by train or the plane.&nbsp;</p>
